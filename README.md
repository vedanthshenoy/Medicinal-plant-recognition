# Medicinal-plant-recognition
This is a Support vector classifier model which can classify medicinal plants from non-medicinal plants and also obtain which species the medicinal plant belongs to.

## Preprocessing 

Firstly, the main thing to be done whiile begining a image based classification task is to preprocess the images in such a way it becomes easy for computation.

When you get an image make sure it has a single channel(grayscale image) because working on single channel image is easier for computation since a coloured image will have three channels. 
Eventhough we are reducing the image down to single channel from three channels it is interesting to note that, the information we want to classify the image into it's species is not lost in the process.

Once we have a grayscale image next thing is to extract features from the image.

Here, i used the texture information in the leaf images since alone using the texture information resulted in a 91.7% accuracy which was very much desirable for experimental and/or research purposes.

Texture defines the consistency of patterns and colors in an object/image such as bricks, school uniforms, sand, rocks, grass etc. To classify objects in an image based on texture, we have to look for the consistent spread of patterns and colors in the objectâ€™s surface. Rough-Smooth, Hard-Soft, Fine-Coarse are some of the texture pairs one could think of, although there are many such pairs.

I used Haralick features to obtain the texture feature information from the preprocessed image. Haralick feature is a image processing technioque used to extract texture based information.
